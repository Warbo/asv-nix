Subject: Test that asv example env plugin works
Message-Id: <a3d479ae5f8a58b8-0-artemis@nixos>

asv's test suite comes with an example environment plugin:

https://github.com/spacetelescope/asv/commit/b03a08fcff6407aec63aa327685750ee28072ebd

We should copy this, and make sure it's working before we start to do
any serious work.
